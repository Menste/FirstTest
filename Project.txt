Movement of character = transform.forward like an "addForce". (change physics material for gorund)
Character can move on Input Axis (it's work with mobile and keybioard). I've closed my application thinking about PC
Geometric forms used like 3dModels. (I can change everything at the end of the project with HDRP and high polygon 3d models.

All floats are publics. Everyone can change the values from the inspector menu
